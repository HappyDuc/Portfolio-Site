            <h2>Professional Life</h2>
            <p>
              I have experience in the service industry, working as a FOH team
              member at Nando's, this involved multi-roling during shifts as a
              grill-cook, food prep and waiting staff. Working there taught me a
              variety of key skills that I would need to progress professionally
              and I believe it was a highly beneficial role early in my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other than Nando's I have also worked at a bike repair shop over
              the summers whilst not at university. During my time there I
              covered many different roles, including managing bike rentals,
              completing many different types of repairs and also being a part
              of the sales team advertising and demonstrating high value items
              (electric bikes, premium accessories, etc).

            <h2>Academics</h2>
            <p>
              Having completed my secondary education I am currently attending
              Heriot-Watt University studying Computer Science and I have
              maintained an A grade average and I have also been awarded the
              Deputy Principal's Award for achieving Grade A, or equivalent, in
              six or more courses in a given year.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would describe myself as having a deep, innate passion for
              computers and computation, having been interested in the inner
              workings for all of my life. I try to constantly have a "passion
              project" that I can work on in my free time to learn more about
              the topics it is pertinent to. In the past this has included
              getting a RaspberryPi and working with a breadboard to create
              simple software->hardware systems. More recently I worked on a
              dynamic route planner to (theoretically) navigate my university
              campus quickly, with plans to include real-time data to account
              for busy times of day. This website has also been a fun project
              for me, it has been very enjoyable to create a strictly planned
              site that takes advantage of the topics I have learned at
              university but with the freedom of it being my own.

            <h2>Personal Life</h2>
            <p>
              Outside of my career and studies, I keep myself busy in a variety
              of ways; my flatmate and I are slowly making our way through a
              long list of "must-watch" movies that neither of us have seen. I
              am also deeply passionate about music, always exploring new genres
              and artists to broaden my taste. [<a

                target="_blank"
                >Spotify Wrapped</a
              >] I am also an avid gym-goer, it would probably be imprudent to
              call myself an amateur bodybuilder but I have spent over 2 years
              going to the gym 5 days a week and have made a lot of progress
              that I am very proud of [SBD: 120, 95, 140] as of 29/12/25.
              Finally, I thoroughly enjoy a wide array of video games, leaning
              most often towards realistic shooters and milsim games (War
              Thunder, Escape From Tarkov, etc) but also have a penchant for
              Minecraft, almost always heavily modded with tech mods,
              unsurprisingly I also quite enjoy Factorio. An honorable mention
              would be my love for Terraria, specifically the Calamity mod which
              I have beaten on a variety of difficulties.
